### I heard that cover letters are dead and that I should just focus on designing a great resume. Is this true?

I’ve had a number of students ask me about the importance of writing a cover letter when applying for graphic design jobs. They have heard from various sources that nobody reads them and that they should just focus on the resume. 

I wish I could tell you that there is an all-in-one formula that works for everyone and every job. Unfortunately, that’s not how it works. Every job you will apply for is different because every company is different. For every time somebody tells you not to write a cover letter, somebody else will tell you that the cover letter is king and that the resume is only a secondary guide.

### So What Should I Do?

Let me start by saying that I whole-heartedly believe in the cover letter as the best chance to position yourself to get an interview, but I also believe that you have take your audience into account. 

### Small Design Firms and In-House Positions at Small Companies

The key word here is small. Most small design firms as well as most small companies in general will have high expectations about anyone they invite to join their team. They are looking for talent but they are also looking for a very certain individual. They are not just hiring a person, they are investing in their company. 

Think about it. In a company of 10 or less, each person is 10% of that company. They share air, they share space, they have to not only be good at what they do, but they have to be good together. Company culture is very important and they are going to expect that you not only bring something to contribute to that culture, but that you will thrive in it.

It wouldn’t be outrageous to assume that when you go to and interview at a small company or firm that everyone who works there attends the meeting. Each person plays a key role and each will likely have a say in who gets hired. Each person wants to feel comfortable that the new hire will not only produce great work, but won’t be a total turd to share a cubicle with.

To land an interview at a small place, you’ll need to position yourself carefully. You need to really do your research. Learn everything you can about this company. Study their website, look at their past work, read their blog, see if any of their team members have social media pages that can give you insight. It’s your job to do your research. This research is two fold. You are learning about the company so you can speak to them like an informed person, but you are also assessing whether or not you are good fit. 

It’s important to consider that accepting a job is a two way street. They have to like you and your work, but the same goes for you. If you don’t feel like you can identify with the mission statement, you don’t particularly care for the work, and the whole team doesn’t strike you as people you want to spend 40+ hours a week with, you might keep looking.

### Big Design Firms and In-House Positions at Big Companies

I hate to say it, but in most bigger companies, you might only be 1% or .5% or maybe less of the total company. They may have great company culture, but they can afford to take a bigger risk when hiring. They will look for talent, but are likely less concerned with measuring the specifics of your personality quirks against everyone else around. 

They may have a very high functioning HR department that vets all who apply using advanced algorithms and fancy hiring software. There is nothing wrong with this, this is the way of the world, but it is very important that you know the company and the basics of their inner-workings so that you can tailor your application and increase your chances of being a good match for their needs as well as for your own.

Chances are for large companies it will be your resume rather than your cover letter that gets you in the door. You’ll need to have a killer portfolio, that goes without saying, but more than likely the resume will be the piece that gets sent around the various departments whereas the cover letter may get separated off.  

You still need to do your research when considering applying to a large company or firm. When and if you do get asked for an interview you need to be prepared to speak to how you would fit into the inner workings of the company and how your work style and ethic meld with the established brand of their particular company.

### The Cover Letter

In both cases, I still argue you should write a killer cover letter. Nobody likes a form letter. Nobody likes to read a letter that screams I sent this exact document to a ton of other people, probably even some of them today. I would argue, what’s the point of sending it if you aren’t going to put any real effort into it?

#### The Real Opportunity

Your cover letter is your chance at a solid first impression. Make sure to take advantage of the opportunity to make it clear to your reader that you want to work for/with them, not that you just want a job. Show them you’ve done the hard work to do your research and that you not only would be a good fit for the open position they are describing, but that you would be a good fit for the type of work they do, for the processes they run, and for the clients they work with.

Make sure to address your letter to an actual person. Do the work to find out who to address it to. Never address it to whomever it may concern, that is the worst and screams I sent this to 30 other companies today.

Show them you know and understand their work. If you’ve done your homework, you’ll know any recent awards they’ve won, blogposts they’ve written, talks they’ve given, or something that really struck you when you read about it. Mention it. Let them know that you really appreciated the Skillshare class they had on poster design or that you thought that the work they did for X company was really something special. 

Now, talk about yourself. Be authentic. Avoid generalities like I love design work and would love to work for your company. Instead talk about specifics that make you a great candidate. Speak to your strengths using actual examples of your work and your experiences. Maybe point out a specific project where you did X or Y and relate it to the position they are advertising for.

In close, make sure to offer to provide any extra information or to come in to talk more about your work or the open position. Remind them that of where they can view your portfolio and how best to get in touch with you. Thank them for their consideration and let them know you’d be happy to answer any questions.

Remember that the cover letter is a chance for you to contextualize your experiences and introduce your personality. Your resume just sums up facts to a certain extent, the cover letter contextualizes them.
