Would you expect a plumber, an electrician, or a hair stylist to repair your pipes, wire your house, or cut your hair for free? I very sincerely doubt it. Would you expect an architect to plan a building, a dentist to fill a cavity, or a baker to provide you bread for free? Again, probably not. Design, just like any I've already listed, is a job, a real one. It requires time, skill, equipment, specialty training, and additionally it provides an actual tangible product.

It's strange to me that even though most people do expect to pay for most services and products, that designers still have trouble convincing people to pay _(or even asking for payment)_ for their time, expertise, and one-of-a-kind, hand-crafted product. It seems like a no-brainer to me that design provides a valuable service, especially since most design work is created in order to generate income for others. 

Look at it like this - the logo you just made for that new business is a major marketing tool for that business, and furthermore, that sign your mark just got applied to _(maybe you designed that too)_ is also an advertising tool meant to attract and draw in customers _(read income)_ to that business. Does it seem fair that they business reaps all that benefit and you, well, get nothing but the satisfaction of a job well done? I don't think so.

## Portfolio Work is Not a Payment

Maybe you were convinced that doing a certain project for free was worthwhile because it would be a great portfolio project. This happens all the time, but it does not make it OK. Sure, everyone needs great work in their portfolio to show achievement and capability, but the cost of admission is just too high. The portfolio payment has become a staple pitch and unfortunately is causing major problems for everyone. Even many very experienced designers now struggle to find someone willing to pay for design work because they know that all they need to do is play to our Achilles heal, our desire for a stronger portfolio. If everyone falls for this, then nobody gets paid. 

On the other hand, if nobody agrees to work for free, then businesses lose their power. They will need to find room in their budget to support our businesses and our families just like we do theirs. Fair is fair. I don't tell my hair stylist that she should cut my hair for free because it's a great portfolio piece, and I don't tell my plumber to fix my toilet for the great Yelp review I'll write, right? We can do better, but it's up to us. Nobody will do it for us.

It's important that all designers, student and professional alike, join together to correct the notion that design is a right and should be provided by trained craftspeople as a free service to others. Even student designers have some level of specialty training, time, and equipment that are needed to complete design work. They too deserve compensation, albeit somewhat less than those more experienced, but compensation just the same. I know many people who get haircuts at cosmetology schools because of the great discounts given in exchange for allowing the students to practice, to build their portfolios. Again, fair is fair.

Not sure how to take the first step toward paid work? I've outlined a step-by-step process to help get you started.

### 1. Complete Any Existing Work As Is
First off, it is difficult to change anything mid-stream without breaking promises and trust. My advice is to finish any projects you are currently engaged in according to whatever terms _(or lack thereof)_ you had. It was your responsibility to negotiate terms with your client ahead of time, if you didn't, then consider it a solid learning experience. You can't take your mistakes out on your client, it will damage your credibility.

### 2. No More Free Work

Make a commitment to yourself that you will not be accepting any more free projects. Create a script if it helps to respond to any emails, phone calls, or in-person requests. Make sure to confront your fees in advance. If they ask about portfolio work, pro-bono, or volunteer possibilities, let them know gently but directly that you aren't currently taking on any unpaid work at this time and if they would like to proceed, you'll be happy to do X, Y, and Z for them _(see step 4 for more details)_.

### 3. Prepare a Contract Template

In order to hold both you and your new client accountable, you'll need to require a contract on the very next project that comes your way. A contract will ensure that both you and your client are on the same page in terms of what work will be performed, when it will be completed, and what the associated costs will be. It's a good idea to draft your contract template while you're finishing up any existing work, so you'll be ready when the next job comes along.

If you are new to contracts, I've written an article specifically on [design contracts](http://learn.elbongurk.com/issues/8-every-design-project-needs-a-contract/) that you are more than welcome to check out. It is by no means a definitive source on the subject, but it is a great place to start.

### 4. Develop a Process that Works For You

The contract on its own will be a huge leap in terms of getting paid for design work, that's for sure. However, more important than getting a client to sign that contract, is to make sure that any client you take on understands exactly the terms. 

It is your job to educate your client on what it is you will do for them and how it will work. This is more than an agreement stating that you will design two posters, in two weeks, for two-hundred dollars _(for example)_.  Your contract can easily accomplish that. What I'm describing is the what a client can and should expect from day one through the project completion.

The process I'm trying to get at here is more of a formula for how you do business. I mentioned in step 2 that you should create a script for addressing the issue of fees upfront with any new client. This is a great start, but it needs to go further. You should also consider including in that script information about whether or not you offer free consultations, detailed quotes, or deposits to hold a place in your project calendar. 

Also plan for what happens during your consultation, during the active working phase of the project, and at the project completion. Be prepared to describe those stages in detail to your client in advance. Think through things like the typical number of feedback sessions and how you handle final deliverables for example. Be thorough.
		
Having a clear process from initial touch point though final handshake will not only make you appear more professional and put together, it will give you the much needed structure to lean on to ensure that you will be taken seriously and that you will be paid.

### A Good Outcome For All

It is our responsibility as designers and as professionals to educate our clients, to help them understand what designers actually do. We need to describe both our role and our value. We owe it our clients, our peers, and ourselves to politely, but directly outline our process including our required compensation for our time and our work. We cannot expect that our clients will come to us already fluent in design process and outcomes, that's why they came to us in the first place. 

An educated client understands what they are getting, and most, once they get the hang of it, will think paying for design is a real bargain. They pay us a fraction of what they will make as a result of our efforts, how can they see it any other way?

Talking about money isn't easy for most of us. It's not in our nature to make demands or initiate difficult conversations, but nothing easy is really worth doing and if we don't do it, who will?
